It covers how proxies, VPNs, and other tools can help you access restricted information securely. The primary method involves using a proxy server as an intermediary. A proxy server connects you to blocked content while hiding your activity from the censoring authority. Many governments and institutions block popular VPNs and proxy services, so for more secure and reliable access, you might consider setting up your own proxy or VPN server.

V2Ray is a robust proxy tool that enhances privacy, bypasses censorship, and supports multiple protocols. It encrypts internet traffic, ensuring secure and unrestricted browsing. Note: V2Ray is a protocol framework, not a server provider. You can either set up your own server or use a provider (often referred to as \"\u673a\u573a\" in Chinese). Common Protocols: VLESS : Lightweight and generally better for servers. VMESS : More configurable with advanced features for bypassing strict censorship. The most popular setup is: VLESS + CDN + WS + TLS . Explanation of Terms Term Meaning VLESS A protocol used in V2Ray configurations. WS WebSocket, an upgraded HTTP protocol supporting real-time data syncing. TLS Encryption protocol protecting data from being visible to firewalls. CDN Content Delivery Network; caches content closer to users for speed and makes servers harder to block. Setup: VLESS + CDN + WS + TLS Requirements A domain name (e.g., via Cloudflare) A Linux VPS with port forwarding for 443 and a random port (Web hosting services like Render or Koyeb can also work; they often include a domain and CDN.) Basic command-line skills Install X-UI Run the following command to install x-ui : bash bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NidukaAkalanka/x-ui-english/master/install.sh) Follow the instructions to install. Ensure you enable system startup . Disable Firewall If using a Debian-based distro: Install ufw (if not already installed): bash sudo apt install ufw Disable the firewall: bash sudo ufw disable Access X-UI Panel Open your browser and navigate to: http://<server-ip>:<port-you-set> Log in with your credentials. Set Up the VLESS Endpoint In the X-UI panel, click \"Inbounds\" . Click the \"+\" button to add a new inbound. Configure as follows: Remark: VLESS Protocol: vless Listening IP: (Leave Blank) Port: 443 Total Traffic (GB): (Leave Blank) Expiry Date: (Leave Blank) Disable Insecure Encryption: False Transmission: ws Accept Proxy Protocol: False Path: (Keep Default) TLS: False Sniffing: True Click \"Add To\" to save. Forward Port 443 Access your VPS control panel or router settings. Forward port 443 . Set Up Cloudflare Ensure your domain is active in Cloudflare. Add an A Record pointing to your VPS IP. The name can be anything you like. Ensure the proxy is enabled . Navigate to the SSL/TLS tab in Cloudflare: Change the mode to Full (not Full Strict ). You're Done! You can now configure your V2Ray client. Tip: Refer to your client documentation or search online for configuration guides.","title":"V2ray"},{"location":"guide/V2ray/#v2ray-setup-guide","text":"","title":"V2Ray Setup Guide"},{"location":"guide/V2ray/#what-is-v2ray","text":"V2Ray is a robust proxy tool that enhances privacy, bypasses censorship, and supports multiple protocols.

While VPN servers can be easily blocked, using a stealth VPN, such as OpenVPN over TCP port 443, can help you avoid detection. This setup is particularly effective in school or office environments. Proton VPN is a solid choice, as it is the only free VPN service that has no data cap or bandwidth limit and supports both WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. Building your own VPN server is generally not recommended, as it can be complex and carries certain risks.
