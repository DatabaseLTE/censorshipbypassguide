Welcome to the **Censorship Bypass Guide**, a personal hub for navigating internet censorship.

This site includes **detailed, easy-to-follow guides** to help you set up your own censorship bypass toolsâ€”both on servers and client devices. Whether you're just starting out or have some experience, you'll likely find something useful here. If the main site isn't accessible, you can also read the guides directly on GitHub in markdown format.

If you have questions, want to discuss ideas, or share your own methods, you're welcome to join the **[forum](https://forum.7844380499.cfd)**. It's a space for people who care about open access to information.

**A note from the creator:**
I'm Chinese, and English isn't my first language, so I used AI to help with spelling and grammar. Hopefully, that makes things clearer.

The first Russian translation of this guide is also available.

This is a community project, and suggestions or pull requests are always appreciated.
