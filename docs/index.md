This guide provides techniques for bypassing internet censorship imposed by institutions like governments, schools, or workplaces. It covers how proxies, VPNs, and other tools can help you access restricted information securely.

The primary method involves using a proxy server as an intermediary. A proxy server connects you to blocked content while hiding your activity from the censoring authority.

Many governments and institutions block popular VPNs and proxy services, so for more secure and reliable access, you might consider setting up your own proxy or VPN server.
