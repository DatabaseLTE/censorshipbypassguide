### **What is a Web Proxy?**

A web proxy allows you to access websites indirectly by routing your connection through a third-party server. While web proxies are great for bypassing restrictions in controlled environments, they are limited to handling web traffic.

For broader use cases, such as accessing desktop applications or creating virtual workspaces, consider more versatile tools like **Kasm Workspaces**. For simpler needs, a web proxy like Doge Unblocker gets the job done.
