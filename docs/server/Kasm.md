## **How Can Kasm Help Bypass Censorship?**

By setting up Kasm Workspaces on a remote Virtual Private Server (VPS), users can bypass censorship effectively. Kasm provides encrypted, browser-based access to applications, making it difficult for censors to track your activities. Unlike standard web proxies, Kasm enables access to full tools such as **Visual Studio Code** or a terminal remotely.

### **Advantages:**
- **Encryption:** Secure and private communication.
- **Versatility:** Remote access to full applications and development tools.
- **Stealth:** Activities appear as regular web browsing to observers.

### **Limitations:**
- **No GPU Acceleration:** Kasm doesn't support GPU-intensive tasks.
- **Limited Graphics Performance:** Pre-rendered graphics on the server can result in slow performance, making it unsuitable for streaming videos or gaming.

## **Kasm Workspaces Setup**

### **Prerequisites:**
- A **domain name**
- A **Linux VPS** with port 443 forwarded
- Basic command-line skills
- Root access

---

### **Step 1: Become Root**

Run the following command to switch to the root user:
```bash
sudo -s
```

---

### **Step 2: Install Kasm Workspaces**

Execute this command to download and install Kasm:
```bash
cd /tmp && curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/kasm_release_1.13.1.421524.tar.gz && tar -xf kasm_release_1.13.1.421524.tar.gz && bash kasm_release/install.sh
```

During the installation, you will need to agree to the End User License Agreement (EULA). After installation, Kasm will provide credentials such as the admin username and password. Save this information in a secure location.

---

### **Step 3: Verify Installation**

Visit your server's IP address in a browser using HTTPS. For example:
```
https://<your-server-ip>
```

You should see a warning screen about an untrusted certificate. Proceed to the site.

### **Step 4: Configure SSL with Let’s Encrypt**

1. **Stop Kasm:**
   ```bash
   /opt/kasm/bin/stop
   ```

2. **Install Let’s Encrypt:**
   (Assumes you're using a Debian-based distribution)
   ```bash
   apt -y install letsencrypt && cd /opt/kasm/current/certs
   ```

3. **Obtain an SSL Certificate:**
   Replace `example.com` with your domain name:
   ```bash
   certbot certonly --standalone --agree-tos --preferred-challenges http -d example.com
   ```

4. **Backup Existing Certificates:**
   ```bash
   mv kasm_nginx.crt kasm_nginx.crt.bk && mv kasm_nginx.key kasm_nginx.key.bk
   ```

5. **Set Up Symlinks for Certificates:**
   ```bash
   ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem kasm_nginx.key
   ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem kasm_nginx.crt
   ```

6. **Restart Kasm:**
   ```bash
   /opt/kasm/bin/start
   ```
