VPN Servers

In most cases, a VPN server is sufficient to bypass censorship. Since VPN servers are easily blocked, using a stealth VPN like OpenVPN over TCP port 443 will make it harder for them to detect. Actually, this works quite well at schools or offices.

The good thing about Proton VPN is that it stands out because it doesn't have a data cap or bandwidth limit, and it uses both WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. Generally, building your VPN server is not advisable, as in addition to its complexity, doing so introduces some level of risks.

If Proton VPN or other providers are not effective for you, then consider methods that are alternative options.
