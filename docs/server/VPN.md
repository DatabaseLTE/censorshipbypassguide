# VPN Servers

In many cases, a VPN server is sufficient for bypassing censorship. While VPN servers can be easily blocked, using a stealth VPN, such as OpenVPN over TCP port 443, can help you avoid detection. This setup is particularly effective in school or office environments.

Proton VPN is a solid choice, as it is the only free VPN service that has no data cap or bandwidth limit and supports both WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. Building your own VPN server is generally not recommended, as it can be complex and carries certain risks.

If Proton VPN or other providers donâ€™t work for you, consider alternative methods.
