# Local Bypass

> **Note:** These methods may only work in environments utilizing Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).

## What is a Local Bypass?

A local bypass, such as GoodbyeDPI, is a tool designed to bypass internet censorship by manipulating data packets directly on your device. It targets the mechanisms employed by Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems to block or throttle content, enabling access to restricted websites or services without needing a full VPN or proxy setup.

## How It Works

1. **Packet Manipulation:** Alters data packets to confuse filtering systems, such as by fragmenting packets or modifying headers to make them harder to detect.
2. **DNS Spoofing/Encryption:** Bypasses DNS-based censorship by redirecting or encrypting DNS queries, avoiding domain-blocking mechanisms.
3. **TLS/HTTPS Obfuscation:** Disguises secure traffic patterns by obfuscating HTTPS connections to make it harder for DPI systems to identify and block traffic.
4. **Protocol Switching:** Switches to less-restricted protocols or ports, such as using alternative protocols that the censorship system does not block.

These methods operate locally on your device, eliminating the need for external intermediaries.

## Potential Drawbacks

1. **Limited Effectiveness:** May not work in all environments or against more advanced DPI systems.
2. **Privacy Concerns:** Manipulating packets and redirecting DNS queries may introduce privacy risks.
